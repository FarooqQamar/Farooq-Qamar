3AI Care is launching a new business venture, expanding its existing Day Hospital Facility which currently specializes in dental and oral-maxillofacial procedures under general anesthesia.  This independent ambulatory facility provides a collaborative environment for specialist anesthetists and peri-operative nurses to deliver expert care to dental and oral surgery patients. The new business will adopt a teal color theme and incorporate 'infusion health and care' into its name. A simple, short logo related to health and specifically infusion will be designed.  To facilitate client bookings, a form will be implemented to capture essential information such as name, email, mobile number, preferred day and time. Preferred imagery will emphasize a clean and sterile environment, professional medical staff, medical equipment, patient comfort, and informative infographics and diagrams.  3AI Care will provide detailed information on iron infusion and Vitamin B12 injection services.  Recognizing the importance of targeted marketing, 3AI Care will consider specific health conditions and lifestyle factors that contribute to deficiencies when defining the target audience for these new services
